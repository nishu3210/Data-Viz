# Data-Viz
Project on visualizing and exploring World Development Indicator data by the World Bank.

Abstract:
This project is about getting insights from the World Development Indicator dataset provided by the World Bank and explore other related datasets, and in the process validating the results presented in the book “Factfulness” by Hans Rosling. And finally, being able to at least explore if not answer the question: is world a better place than we think?

All of the work is done in python. A html copy of Jupyter Notebook is uploaded for reference, please view that as "plotly" charts won't load in Github.
